# ccnet

*Ccnet*, cell-cell network, is a single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis package based on non-uniform epsilon-neighborhood network (NEN).

## Features

- Different from the traditional analysis of scRNA-seq data, which performs visualization, clustering and trajectory inference using methods based on different theories, *ccnet* accomplishes the three targets in a consistent manner.
- NEN network combines the advantages of both k-neighbors (KNN) and epsilon-neighborhood (EN) to represent the intrinsic manifold of data.


## Installation

Install *ccnet* from pip:

	pip install ccnet

Or, to build and install run from source:

	python setup.py install

## Usage

For the usage of *ccnet*, please refer to example, where we introduce the relevant analysis steps, including visualization, clustering, pseudotime ordering, finding trajectory-associated genes, etc.
